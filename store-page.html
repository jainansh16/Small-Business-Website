                <p>This tablet is top class. It has face ID. There is no home button so that the screen can be even
                    larger for people who love huge screens but do not want to buy a laptop because this is cheaper.</p>

                <p>This computer is very high-tech. It has a face-ID, as well as a touch-ID. The whole computer is touch
                    screen. That's right! The screen, the keyboard, and the trackpad is all touchscreen. This allows for
                    a lot of customization for users based on apps they are using. This laptop can also fold into a
                    tablet.</p>

                <p>This pen is fabulous. It works with all of the other new products released: the phone, tablet, and
                    computer. The pen links to each via bluetooth and can automatically switch based on the device that
                    is being used. It can be used for drawings, the whole laptop (including the keyboard and trackpad),
                    and much more! This stylus also works on some of our old devices.</p>
